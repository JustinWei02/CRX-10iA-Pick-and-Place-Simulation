To run the simulation, place the src folder in a workspace and build it. 

Then in this order, launch the following files from each package: gazebo.launch.py (crx_10ia_description), controller.launch.py (crx_10ia_controller),
moveit.launch.py (crx_10ia_moveit), target_localization.launch.py (target_localization), and action.launch.py (crx_10ia_action)
